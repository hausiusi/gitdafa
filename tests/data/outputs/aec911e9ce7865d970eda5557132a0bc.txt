    Get commits per tag, total commits and better UI
    
    Structural updates. A lot of improvements and functional enhancements:
    
    * Changed structure of git and models packages in order to simplify its
    usage, make more flexible for changes and enhanceable.
    * Added tag count and commits per tag.
    * During initialization Statistics class counts total number of commits
    (actually it takes a while for big repositories, but later it simplifies
    time estimation and percentage calculation for other functions).
    * Improved printing in user interface, now it prints tables of authors
    with their statistical data: added, deleted lines and their total
    commits count.
    * In the end the results are saved as text (with tables) like
    ./results/<program_run_date_project_dir>/stats.txt.
    * Created and applied TableInterface metaclass for those objects that
    have to displayed as tables (for this purpose we need to be guaranteed
    that two functions: get_table_row and get_table_headers will be
    available in the object. Currently Author and Tag objects use this
    interface as they are the only ones that are stringified as a table.
